# caesar
A CLI tool based on the caesar cipher


*This tool was created for the purpose of using the caesar cipher within
the command line interface instead of a website (but that's your own personal preference honestly)*

To Install This Package Run The **Following Command Below**
```sh
npm i -g @pixeledluawriter/caesar
```

or you can clone this repo via this command down below

```sh
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/PixeledLuaWriter/caesar.git && cd caesar
```

# Flags

**Shift**: Required for the Caesar Cipher/ROT13 algorithm
**Encrypt**: Takes User Input and provided shift number and encrypts it with the algorithm

```sh
caesar --shift 6 --encrypt this is a funny test obviously

[stuff from the tool below]
```

**Decrypt**: [WIP AND CURRENTLY KINDA BROKEN] Takes User Input And Provided Shift Number And Decrypts it back to normal

```sh
caesar --shift -3 --decrypt yhvy

[stuff from the tool below]
